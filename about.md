This theme uses some parts of Twitter Bootstrap, which allows it to look nice on a mobile devices using a collapsable nav bar and hiding the
sidebar.

All these features could be set up in `_config.yml`. Also you can have social icons which could lead to your social acounts. Out-of-the box it has: LinkedIn, GitHub, StackOverflow, LastFm, Instagram. You can easily add more by putting svg images in a /css/social folder.
